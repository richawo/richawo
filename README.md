### Hey, I'm Richard 👋🏾

*I'm a Full-Stack Builder from London - working on everything from ideas → deployment.*

*I started as an [Actuary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuary), but after automating my first role 3 months in, I fell in love with engineering. Then, I became hooked on startups after becoming an early employee and growing a B2B SaaS startup from ≈0 to >$10m ARR (2x acq)! Now, I’m a Full-Stack Engineer - with 10+ years of experience designing, building and shipping products that people love!*

*Since March, I've been building a suite of AI tools ([Nack](https://nack.ai)) with my brother, entirely bootstrapped. Our multi-modal mobile assistant has thousands of users across ≈100 countries, and now we have over a dozen businesses waiting on our B2B, AI-powered SEO tool (launching soon).*
