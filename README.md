### Bio

*Hey, I'm Richard 👋🏾 -  a Full-Stack Builder from London working on everything from ideas → deployment.*

*I'm a former Actuary who became hooked on startups after becoming an early employee and growing a B2B SaaS startup from ≈0 to >$10m ARR (acquired)! Now, I’m a Full-Stack Engineer - with 10+ years of experience designing, building and shipping products that people love!*

### Recent Projects

*Since March, I've been bootstrapping a suite of AI tools under [Nack](https://nack.ai):*
* A multi-modal mobile assistant has thousands of users across ≈100 countries
* B2B, AI-powered SEO tool (launching soon), with over a dozen businesses on the [waitlist](https://tally.so/forms/w4JLd5).*

*Most of my work is in private repositories, so I've started on a few open-source projects + contributions for more public benefit.*
